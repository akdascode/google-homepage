This is an excercise as per the instructions in The Odin Project.

What skills have I demonstrated? If any, I'd say patience and research. I went out of my way to look for more information outside of what was offered in the pages of TOP
and toyed around with the developer tools. The cached page no longer exist, or so it seems, so I just decided to mmake the page look like I remember Google's homepage back when I was in
highschool.

I got to understand more about how positioning objects "feels" like with CSS and I think I understand how objects can be laid out with the tags. A blank page of coding doesn't look that scary
anymore.

It's really exciting to always learn something new even if but a little.
